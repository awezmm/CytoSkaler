CytoSkaler is an imaging tool that can quantify cellular distribution of antibody staining in sub-cellular areas. First, CytoSkaler uses deep-learning to segment densely populated sub-cellar regions in single image stains. Then, it analyzes pixel distribution patterns in specific regions to generate metrics that can quantify preferential binding at those specific regions.

CytoSkaler provides otherwise unknown quantitative data on relative preference of binding to different sub-cellular structures, not accounted for by assays like polyreactivity ELISAs.


# Type of Data to Use 
CytoSkaler uses one or multiple image sets for analysis. A single image set is a collection of stain images that focus on the same field of view. 
Here is an example of a single image set:
